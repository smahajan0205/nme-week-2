# ðŸªª React Profile Card Starter

Welcome to your first NME React project!  
This is your starter code for the **Intro to React** workshop.  
Youâ€™ll be creating a personal **Profile Card** using **React components, props, and state**.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:smahajan0205/nme-week-2.git
   cd nme-week-2


2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
3. **Run the Development Server **

   npm run dev

.

##  Your Assignment
Create a reusable React ProfileCard component that displays:

1. Your name

2. Your major

3. Your hobbies

4. A fun fact

(Optional) a profile pic

## ðŸª„ Steps
1. Open src/ProfileCard.jsx
   
2. Replace the placeholder content with your own details.
   
3. Use props if you want to make the card reusable for multiple people.

## ðŸ“¸ Submitting
Push your own version to GitHub! 

Style it however you like using App.css.

Add a button that toggles something using useState (e.g. hide/show fun fact or switch between light/dark mode).
